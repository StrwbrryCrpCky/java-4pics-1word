Hey, so you're one of the few who actually reads this.

So just run the java code... IN TERMINAL, not on the built in VSCode debugger (for some reason, the s*****kopf wouldn't work)

To run this in terminal:

Open Terminal (or PowerShell) then:

type "cd C:\[location of the folder]"
type "javac JavaGame.java"
type "java JavaGame"

anyways that it, peace
